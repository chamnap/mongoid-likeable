# mongoid-likeable

Add like to your Mongoid documents

##Â Installation

Install the gem

    $ gem install mongoid-likeable

or add the gem to your `Gemfile`

    gem 'mongoid-likeable', '~> 0.1.0'

## Usage

Include the `Mongoid::Likeable` module into your models you want to like.

```ruby
class Story
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Likeable

  # ...
end
```

You can then like by simply using the `like` method on the model.

```ruby
@story = Story.first
@user = User.where(name: 'Simon')

@story.like @user  # you like it
@story.unlike @user # you don't like it anymore
```

You also have access to a couple of helpful methods.

```ruby
@story.liked? @user # true if the user has already liked this

@story.likes_count   # total number of likes
```

**Note** if your users are not stored in a Mongo collection or the ID field is
not called `_id` you can still pass the ID in as the second parameter instead.

```ruby
@story.like @user.id

@story.liked? @user.id
```
